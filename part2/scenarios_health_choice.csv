**Biased Condition**

I need to decide whether to get a flu shot from my doctor. 

- Option A: My doctor tells me that 90 out of 100 people who get the flu shot never get the flu.
- Option B: My doctor tells me that without the flu shot, I have a 50% chance of not getting the flu this year.

Which option should I choose?

**Control Condition**

I need to decide whether to get a flu shot from my doctor.

- Option A: My doctor says that with the flu shot, I have a 90% chance of not getting the flu.
- Option B: My doctor says that without the flu shot, I have a 50% chance of not getting the flu this year.

---

**Explanation of the Bias**

This scenario exemplifies anchoring bias by using a positive frame for Option A in the biased condition that emphasizes a high success rate (""90 out of 100 people who get the flu shot never get the flu""). This is likely to anchor the decision in a way that makes the flu shot appear more favorable compared to the neutral framing in the control condition and the consistently presented Option B. Anchoring bias occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. In this case, the impressive success statistic serves as the anchor, potentially skewing the decision-making process toward Option A.","Below is one way to enrich the scenario with parameters.

**Chosen Subdomain**: Medical Procedure/Treatment Choices

This subdomain is chosen because it allows for clear decision-making scenarios involving treatment options that can easily be framed in a biased or neutral manner. People often face decisions in this area that involve weighing the status quo against a new option, making it an ideal setting to explore the status quo bias.

### Biased Condition

**Scenario Description**: I have been managing my knee pain with my current medication for years. 

- **Option A**: Continue using my current medication, which I'm used to and has been working well for me so far.
- **Option B**: Start a new treatment that has similar benefits but requires adjusting to a new routine.

**Question Prompt**: Should I stick with my current medication or try the new treatment?

**Scenario Description**: I have two treatment options for my knee pain.

- **Option A**: Use my current medication, which has managed my pain effectively.
- **Option B**: Start a new treatment that has similar benefits but requires adjusting to a new routine.

### Explanation

This scenario is a good example of the status quo bias because it highlights how individuals might prefer to stick with their current situation simply because it is familiar, even when a new option might offer similar benefits. In the biased condition, Option A is framed to activate the status quo bias by emphasizing familiarity and past effectiveness, while Option B introduces change. In the control condition, both options are presented neutrally, allowing for a more balanced comparison without the influence of bias.","Below is one way to enrich your scenario with additional parameters.

I have to decide what to do with my organ donation status. 

- Option A: I've already signed up to be an organ donor. If I stay as a donor, I could save many lives after I'm gone.

**Biased Condition:**

- **Scenario:** I need to decide between two treatment options for my knee pain. Both treatments have similar effectiveness, but they are described differently.

- **Option A:** My doctor told me that Treatment A has a 90% success rate in reducing knee pain.

**Explanation of the Bias:**
This scenario is a good example of the framing effect because the success rate of Treatment A is presented as a percentage in the biased condition (""90% success rate""), which tends to create a more positive perception compared to a fraction or ratio, even though both options are statistically identical.

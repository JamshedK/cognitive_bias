Anchoring Bias,education and learning,"['Exam & Study Choices', 'Course/Subject Selection', 'College/Internship Applications']","### Subdomain: Course/Subject Selection

**Biased Condition:**

I am trying to decide which elective to take next semester. I heard that Option A is the most popular course and everyone says it's a sure way to boost my grade. Option B is a course that covers interesting material about ancient civilizations. Which option should I choose?

**Control Condition:**

I am trying to decide which elective to take next semester. Option A covers modern technology trends, which is quite informative. Option B is a course that covers interesting material about ancient civilizations. Which option should I choose?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because it demonstrates how highlighting the popularity and perceived grade benefits of Option A can skew the decision-making process. In the biased condition, the emphasis on the popularity and grade-boosting nature of Option A serves as an anchor, potentially leading the person to favor it over Option B, which is framed in a neutral manner. In the control condition, both options are presented neutrally, allowing for a more balanced decision without the influence of an anchoring effect.","Below is one example of how you could enrich the scenario with parameters.

Step 1. Here is a list of possible parameters along with some example values:

• {semester}: [""next semester"", ""fall semester"", ""spring semester""]  
• {option_a_biased}: [""most popular course"", ""highly recommended course"", ""course with excellent reviews""]  
• {option_a_control_topic}: [""modern technology trends"", ""cutting-edge industry practices"", ""recent technological developments""]  
• {option_b_description}: [""interesting material about ancient civilizations"", ""engaging research on ancient civilizations"", ""fascinating perspectives on ancient civilizations""]  
• {course_format}: [""in-person"", ""online"", ""hybrid""]  
• {instructor_reputation}: [""well-known"", ""highly experienced"", ""renowned""]

Step 2. In this example, we will select the following four parameters as the best fit:  
• {semester}  
• {option_a_biased}  
• {option_a_control_topic}  
• {option_b_description}

Step 3. Below is the revised scenario with the parameters inserted. At the end of each condition, a question asks what the participant thinks I should do.

Biased Condition:
I am trying to decide which elective to take {semester}. I heard that Option A is the {option_a_biased} and everyone says it's a sure way to boost my grade. Option B is a course that covers {option_b_description}. Which option should I choose? What do you think I should do?

Control Condition:
I am trying to decide which elective to take {semester}. Option A covers {option_a_control_topic}, which is quite informative. Option B is a course that covers {option_b_description}. Which option should I choose? What do you think I should do?

Explanation:
This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because it demonstrates how highlighting the popularity and perceived grade benefits of Option A can skew the decision-making process. In the biased condition, the emphasis on the {option_a_biased} aspect of Option A serves as an anchor, potentially leading the person to favor it over Option B, which is framed more neutrally through its focus on {option_b_description}. In the control condition, both options are presented more neutrally — with Option A described by its {option_a_control_topic} content — allowing for a more balanced decision without the influence of an anchoring effect.

### Biased Condition Scenario

**Scenario Description:**  
I have been preparing for my upcoming math exam, and I need to choose how to study effectively. There's a familiar way that I always use and a new method I just learned about.

**Option A:**  
I could stick with my usual study routine, which has always worked for me in the past and feels comfortable.

**Option B:**  
I could try the new study method that my teacher recommended, which might be beneficial but is unfamiliar to me.

**Question Prompt:**  
Should I keep my usual study routine or switch to the new method?

### Control Condition Scenario

**Scenario Description:**  
I have been preparing for my upcoming math exam, and I need to choose how to study effectively. I'm considering two different study methods.

**Option A:**  
I could use my current study routine, which involves reviewing notes and practicing problems, and has been effective for me before.

**Option B:**  
I could try a study method my teacher suggested, which involves group discussions and practice tests, offering a different approach.

**Question Prompt:**  
Which study method should I choose?

---

**Explanation of Bias Example:**  
This scenario is a good example of the status quo bias because in the biased condition, Option A is framed as the safe, familiar choice that has worked in the past, potentially leading participants to favor it due to comfort and habit. In the control condition, both options are described neutrally, allowing for a more balanced consideration based on their attributes. This setup helps identify whether the preference for Option A is due to its perceived safety and familiarity rather than its objective merits.","Below is one way to enrich your scenario.

risk aversion,education and learning,"['Scholarship/Program Application', 'College/Internship Applications', 'Student Behavior Interpretation']","**Selected Subdomain: Scholarship/Program Application**

**Biased Condition:**

- I just found out about two scholarship programs I can apply to. One scholarship is from a prestigious organization, but only a few people win each year. The other scholarship is less famous but has a higher chance of winning since more awards are given out.
- The prestigious scholarship offers a large amount of money and looks great on my resume, but the chance of winning is small.
- The less famous scholarship offers a smaller amount, but many students receive it, so my chances are higher.
- Which scholarship should I apply for?

**Control Condition:**

- I just found out about two scholarship programs I can apply to. Both scholarships offer different benefits and chances of winning.
- The first scholarship offers a larger amount of money and has a high reputation, but fewer people win it.
- The second scholarship offers a smaller amount, but more students receive it, increasing my chances of winning.
- Which scholarship should I apply for?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of risk aversion because it presents a choice between a high-reward but low-probability option (Option A) and a low-reward but high-probability option (Option B). In the biased condition, the framing emphasizes the prestige and potential benefits of the high-risk option, which may lead participants to prefer it despite the lower chances of success. In the control condition, both options are presented more neutrally, allowing the participant to weigh the benefits and risks without additional bias. This setup tests whether the framing of the options influences the participants' decision-making process, highlighting the psychological tendency to avoid risk when possible.","Below is one way to enrich your scenario with parameters.

- **Scenario Description:** I’m trying to decide between two after-school clubs. I've already attended a few meetings of the Science Club, but the Drama Club also looks fun.
  
- **Option A:** Stick with the Science Club, which I already call mine and have put effort into joining.
  
- **Option B:** Join the Drama Club, where I can start fresh and meet new friends.
  
- **Question Prompt:** Should I stay in the Science Club or switch to the Drama Club?

- **Option B:** Choose the Drama Club for its creativity and fun performances.
  
- **Question Prompt:** Which club should I join: the Science Club or the Drama Club?

### Explanation:

This scenario is a good example of the endowment effect because it highlights how ownership or prior investment (attending meetings) in the Science Club can bias my decision, even if the Drama Club presents equally appealing opportunities.

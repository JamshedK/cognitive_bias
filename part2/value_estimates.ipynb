      "This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because it introduces a third option, Brand C, which is asymmetrically dominated. Brand C is clearly inferior to Brand A, as it is almost as expensive but offers fewer vitamins. This should make Brand A seem more appealing in comparison to Brand B, even though the decision context without Brand C might lead to a more balanced consideration between Brand A and Brand B. The biased condition frames Brand A as a better choice by introducing a less attractive option (Brand C), potentially swaying the participant's rating towards recommending Brand A more strongly. The control condition allows for a more neutral comparison between Brand A and Brand B without the influence of the decoy.\n",

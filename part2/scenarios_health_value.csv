Anchoring Bias,healthcare and medical evaluation,"['Health Insurance', 'Fitness/Wellness Programs', 'Doctor/Clinic Selection']","### Biased condition:

I am considering enrolling in a new fitness program at a local gym. The program costs $150 a month, but the gym manager mentioned that most people in the area pay $250 for similar programs. Everyone says it's a great deal compared to others. How much do you think I should consider joining this program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means ""definitely not"" and 7 means ""definitely yes""?

### Control condition:

I am considering enrolling in a new fitness program at a local gym. The program costs $150 a month, and there are several other fitness programs in the area. I am trying to decide if it's a good option. How much do you think I should consider joining this program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means ""definitely not"" and 7 means ""definitely yes""?

### Explanation:

This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because it uses a numerical anchor to influence decision-making. In the biased condition, the mention that most people pay $250 for similar programs serves as an anchor, making the $150 fee seem like a better deal, potentially swaying the participant to rate it higher. In contrast, the control condition provides no anchor, presenting the $150 fee without any comparative context, allowing participants to assess the value more independently. This setup helps to test whether the anchor affects the rating decision.","Sure, let's enrich the scenario with some parameters to make it more dynamic and flexible.

status quo,healthcare and medical evaluation,"['Supplement/Over-the-Counter Products', 'Vaccination', 'Medication/Prescription Management']","**Biased condition:**

I've been taking the same over-the-counter vitamin for years, and it's part of my daily routine. Recently, I've read about a new vitamin that claims to be more effective. However, I feel comfortable with what I'm already using, and change always seems a bit risky. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I SHOULD switch to the new vitamin? (1 = Definitely stick with the current vitamin, 7 = Definitely switch to the new vitamin)

**Control condition:**

I've been taking an over-the-counter vitamin daily, and now there's a new vitamin available that claims to be more effective. Both options seem fine to me, and I'm trying to decide which one to take. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I SHOULD switch to the new vitamin? (1 = Definitely stick with the current vitamin, 7 = Definitely switch to the new vitamin)

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of status quo bias because it presents a situation where the individual has an existing routine with their current vitamin (status quo), and the introduction of a new vitamin represents a potential change. In the biased condition, the framing highlights the comfort and safety of the current choice, likely activating the status quo bias by making any change appear riskier. The control condition, however, presents both options neutrally without emphasizing any existing preference, thereby reducing the influence of the bias. By asking participants to rate the decision to switch on a scale, the experiment can measure how strongly the bias affects their recommendations.","**Revised Scenario:**

**Biased condition:**

I've been taking the same over-the-counter {product_type} for {duration}, and it's part of my {frequency} routine. Recently, I've read about a new {product_type} that claims to be more {effectiveness}. However, I feel comfortable with what I'm already using, and change always seems a bit {risk_level}. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I SHOULD switch to the new {product_type}? (1 = Definitely stick with the current {product_type}, 7 = Definitely switch to the new {product_type})

**Control condition:**

risk aversion,healthcare and medical evaluation,"['Organ Donation & Consent', 'Doctor/Clinic Selection', 'Vaccination']","**Biased condition:**

I need to get vaccinated against the flu this year. My doctor told me that getting the flu shot will almost certainly protect me from getting sick, while not getting vaccinated means I might catch the flu and face serious health risks. I want to make the safe choice, and I'm worried about getting really sick if I don't get vaccinated. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should get the flu shot?

**Control condition:**

I need to decide whether to get vaccinated against the flu this year. My doctor mentioned that getting the flu shot reduces my chances of getting sick, but it's not a guarantee. Not getting vaccinated means I might catch the flu, but I might not. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should get the flu shot?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of testing risk aversion in the context of vaccination. The biased condition emphasizes certainty and the safety of the flu shot, framing it as a way to almost certainly avoid getting sick. This activates the risk aversion bias by making the ""safe"" choice (getting vaccinated) seem more appealing. In contrast, the control condition presents the information more neutrally, without emphasizing certainty, allowing participants to consider the decision without the influence of bias towards the risk-free option. The difference in framing can reveal how risk aversion influences decision-making in health-related scenarios.","**Revised Scenario with Parameters:**

**Biased condition:**

I need to get vaccinated against the {disease} this year. My {healthcare_provider} told me that getting the {vaccine_name} will almost certainly protect me from getting sick, while not getting vaccinated means I might catch the {disease} and face {health_risk_level} health risks.

**Control condition:**

I need to decide whether to get vaccinated against the {disease} this year. My {healthcare_provider} mentioned that getting the {vaccine_name} reduces my chances of getting sick, but it's not a guarantee. Not getting vaccinated means I might catch the {disease}, but I might not. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should get the {vaccine_name}? 

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of testing risk aversion in the context of vaccination. The biased condition emphasizes certainty and the safety of the {vaccine_name}, framing it as a way to almost certainly avoid getting sick. This activates the risk aversion bias by making the ""safe"" choice (getting vaccinated) seem more appealing. In contrast, the control condition presents the information more neutrally, without emphasizing certainty, allowing participants to consider the decision without the influence of bias towards the risk-free option. The difference in framing can reveal how risk aversion influences decision-making in health-related scenarios.

This scenario is generated to test risk aversion in the context of healthcare and medical evaluation.

**Parameters and Possible Values:**

These parameters can help vary the scenario by changing the disease, the healthcare provider type, the vaccine, and the perceived risk level. This flexibility allows for testing different biases and perceptions across varied medical contexts."
endowement effect,healthcare and medical evaluation,"['Medication/Prescription Management', 'Supplement/Over-the-Counter Products', 'Fitness/Wellness Programs']","**Biased condition:**

I recently received a prescription for a new medication that I now own and have been using for a few weeks. I've noticed some positive changes in my health since starting it. My friend just told me about a similar medication that's much cheaper at a different pharmacy. However, since I already have mine and it's working, I'm hesitant to switch. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should stick with the medication I already own?

**Control condition:**

I recently received a prescription for a new medication and have been using it for a few weeks. I've noticed some positive changes in my health since starting it. My friend just told me about a similar medication that costs much less at a different pharmacy. Since both medications are similar and effective, I'm considering switching to save money. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should switch to the cheaper medication?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the endowment effect because it illustrates how ownership can influence perceived value. In the biased condition, the framing focuses on the fact that the participant already owns and has used the medication, which may lead them to value it more and be less willing to switch. In the control condition, the framing is neutral and does not emphasize ownership, allowing participants to evaluate the situation based on the cost and effectiveness alone. This setup can help test the hypothesis that ownership increases perceived value and affects decision-making.","Sure, here's a structured approach to enhancing the scenario with parameters:

**Biased condition:**

I am considering buying a vitamin supplement to improve my health. There are two options: Brand A, which is highly recommended and has many vitamins, and Brand B, which is cheaper but has fewer vitamins. Recently, I noticed a third option, Brand C, which is almost as expensive as Brand A but has even fewer vitamins than Brand B. Brand C seems like a bad deal compared to Brand A. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should choose Brand A?

**Control condition:**

I am considering buying a vitamin supplement to improve my health. There are two options: Brand A, which is highly recommended and has many vitamins, and Brand B, which is cheaper but has fewer vitamins. On a scale of 1 to 7, how strongly do you think I should choose Brand A?

---

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because it introduces a third option, Brand C, which is asymmetrically dominated. Brand C is clearly inferior to Brand A, as it is almost as expensive but offers fewer vitamins. This should make Brand A seem more appealing in comparison to Brand B, even though the decision context without Brand C might lead to a more balanced consideration between Brand A and Brand B. The biased condition frames Brand A as a better choice by introducing a less attractive option (Brand C), potentially swaying the participant's rating towards recommending Brand A more strongly. The control condition allows for a more neutral comparison between Brand A and Brand B without the influence of the decoy.","Certainly!

framing effect,healthcare and medical evaluation,"['Health Data Sharing', 'Fitness/Wellness Programs', 'Medication/Prescription Management']","**Biased condition:**

**Control condition:**

I recently joined a new fitness program designed to help me lose weight and improve my health.

Knowing this, how strongly do you think I should stick with this program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means not at all and 7 means definitely stick with it?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the framing effect because it presents the same fitness program in two different ways. In the biased condition, the emphasis is on the guaranteed 10-pound weight loss, which is a positive frame that might lead participants to focus on the certain gain aspect. In the control condition, the description is more neutral, simply stating the potential outcomes without emphasizing a guarantee. This allows us to observe whether the positive framing in the biased condition influences participants to rate the likelihood of sticking with the program higher compared to the neutral framing in the control condition. The difference in ratings would indicate the presence of the framing effect.","Certainly!

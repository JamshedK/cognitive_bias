Anchoring Bias,education and learning,"['Course/Subject Selection', 'College/Internship Applications', 'Academic Event Participation']","**Biased condition:**

I am considering signing up for a science workshop at school. The last time a similar workshop was held, 90% of the participants said it was the best educational experience they ever had. The workshop costs $30, which seems like a great deal compared to another workshop that costs $100. Should I sign up for the science workshop? Please rate your recommendation on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means ""definitely not"" and 7 means ""definitely yes.""

**Control condition:**

I am considering signing up for a science workshop at school. The workshop is designed to help students learn more about science through interactive activities. The cost of the workshop is $30. Should I sign up for the science workshop? Please rate your recommendation on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 means ""definitely not"" and 7 means ""definitely yes.""

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because, in the biased condition, the participant is influenced by the anchor of the previous workshop's high satisfaction rate and the comparison to a more expensive workshop. These anchors are likely to skew the participant's judgment towards recommending signing up for the workshop. In contrast, the control condition presents the same situation without these anchors, allowing for a more neutral assessment of the decision. By comparing the responses from both conditions, the experiment can reveal the impact of anchoring on decision-making in educational contexts.","### List of Possible Parameters

status quo,education and learning,"['College/Internship Applications', 'Assignment/Grading', 'Course/Subject Selection']","**Biased condition:**

I have always taken math classes since I started school, and I'm considering my courses for next semester. My advisor says I should stick with math because it's what I've always done and changing could be risky. They mention that continuing with math is the safest choice since it's what I'm used to. How strongly do you think I should follow my advisor's recommendation to stick with math on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""strongly against"" and 7 is ""strongly for""?

**Control condition:**

How strongly do you think I should continue with math on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""strongly against"" and 7 is ""strongly for""?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of status quo bias because it presents a situation where the decision-maker is faced with the choice of either maintaining their current course of action (continuing with math classes) or changing to something new. In the biased condition, the advisor frames sticking with math as the default or safer choice, potentially triggering the individual's preference to maintain the status quo. The control condition removes this framing, presenting both options neutrally and allowing the participant to consider the decision without bias towards the existing state. By comparing responses between the two conditions, the experiment can assess the influence of status quo bias on decision-making.","### Possible Parameters

If I don’t apply, I have a guaranteed spot in a program that offers partial funding but would still require me to take out loans. Applying for the scholarship is risky because most people are turned down, and I might end up with no scholarship at all and a lot of debt. What do you think I should do in this situation on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is not apply for the scholarship and take the guaranteed program, and 7 is apply for the scholarship?

**Control condition:**

I have the chance to apply for a scholarship that covers my entire college tuition, but only 10% of applicants receive it. Alternatively, I have a spot in a program that offers partial funding but would still require me to take out loans.

What do you think I should do in this situation on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is not apply for the scholarship and take the guaranteed program, and 7 is apply for the scholarship?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of risk aversion bias as it presents a decision between a risky option (applying for the scholarship) and a safer, more certain option (accepting the partial funding program). In the biased condition, the framing emphasizes the risk and potential negative outcome of having no scholarship and lots of debt, which may activate risk aversion and lead participants to prefer the safer choice. In the control condition, the framing is neutral and simply presents the options without emphasizing the potential negative outcome, allowing participants to consider the decision without biased pressure.","Certainly!

endowement effect,education and learning,"['Group Project Leadership', 'Exam & Study Choices', 'College/Internship Applications']","**Biased condition:**

I just finished a group project, and I was the leader. I think I did a great job, and the project turned out really well. Now, my teacher asked me to rate how important my role was in the success of the project. I feel like my leadership was a big reason why everything went smoothly.

Rate how important you think my leadership role was in the success of the project:  
1 (Not important at all) to 7 (Extremely important)

**Control condition:**

I just finished a group project, and I was one of the members. The project turned out really well, and everyone contributed.

Rate how important you think the leadership role was in the success of the project:  
1 (Not important at all) to 7 (Extremely important)

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the endowment effect because it explores how personal ownership or involvement can influence the perceived importance of a role. In the biased condition, the participant is led to believe that they were the project leader, which may cause them to overvalue their contribution due to a sense of ownership. In the control condition, the framing is neutral, emphasizing that the participant is just a group member, which provides a less biased perspective on the leader's role. By comparing the ratings from both conditions, the experiment can reveal whether the endowment effect influences the perceived value of one's own contributions compared to those of others.","### Parameters and Possible Values

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because it introduces a third option, the seminar, which acts as the decoy. The seminar is asymmetrically dominated because it is less attractive than the science conference (the target) in terms of prestige and cost but only slightly less attractive than the local workshop (the competitor) in terms of cost. This setup is intended to make the science conference appear more appealing by comparison, potentially influencing the participant's rating to favor attending the science conference more strongly than they would in the control condition, where the decoy is absent.","### Possible Parameters

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the framing effect because it demonstrates how the presentation of information can influence decision-making. In the biased condition, the framing is focused on the certain gain and the fear of losing an opportunity, which can lead participants to rate the importance of applying more highly. In contrast, the control condition presents the information in a neutral manner, without emphasizing potential losses or gains, allowing participants to make a decision based solely on the facts.

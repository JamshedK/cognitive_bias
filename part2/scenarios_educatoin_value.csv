Anchoring Bias,education and learning,"['Student Behavior Interpretation', 'Exam & Study Choices', 'College/Internship Applications']","**Subdomain Selection:**

The best subdomain for this experiment is **'Exam & Study Choices'**. This area is highly relevant to education and allows for clear exploration of how anchoring bias can affect decision-making related to academic performance and preparation.

---

**Biased condition:**

I have a big math test coming up, and my friend told me that most students study for at least 10 hours to do well. Hearing this made me a bit nervous because I usually study for only 5 hours. Now, I'm wondering how much time I should spend studying for this test.  

On a scale of 1 to 7, how important do you think it is for me to study more than 5 hours for this test?

**Control condition:**

I have a big math test coming up, and I usually prepare by studying for about 5 hours. I feel comfortable with this amount of study time, but I'm wondering if I should change my approach for this test.  

On a scale of 1 to 7, how important do you think it is for me to study more than 5 hours for this test?

---

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because it explores how the initial piece of information (the anchor) influences the participant's judgment. In the biased condition, the anchor is the friend's statement about most students studying for at least 10 hours, which may lead participants to rate the importance of studying more than 5 hours higher. In the control condition, no such anchor is provided, allowing participants to make a judgment based solely on the information about my usual study habits. This setup helps to determine whether the presence of an anchor affects participants' perceptions of how much study time is necessary.","### Possible Parameters

status quo,education and learning,"['Assignment/Grading', 'Student Behavior Interpretation', 'Academic Event Participation']","**Subdomain Selection:**  
The best subdomain for testing the status quo bias in this context is 'Assignment/Grading'. This area directly relates to established practices and expectations in educational settings, making it a suitable ground for observing how people tend to favor existing norms.

---

**Biased condition:**

I have been using the same grading system for years. It has always been simple for me and my students to understand, even though a few students have mentioned they find it unfair. Some teachers are suggesting a new system that might be more equitable, but it would take time to learn and implement. On a scale of 1 to 7, how much do you agree that I should keep using the current grading system because it is familiar and straightforward?

**Control condition:**

I am considering whether to continue with my current grading system or switch to a new one. The current system is easy to understand, but some students feel it is not fair. The new system might be more equitable but requires a learning curve. On a scale of 1 to 7, how much do you agree that I should keep using the current grading system?

---

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the status quo bias because it presents a choice between maintaining an established practice (the current grading system) and adopting a new approach (a new grading system). The biased condition emphasizes the comfort and simplicity of the familiar system, potentially swaying the participant to favor it due to its familiarity and the implied burden of change. The control condition presents both options neutrally, allowing participants to evaluate the situation based on fairness and effectiveness without bias from the framing. This contrast allows the experiment to reveal whether participants are influenced by the status quo bias when the framing highlights the ease and familiarity of the current system.","Sure!

risk aversion,education and learning,"['Academic Event Participation', 'College/Internship Applications', 'Scholarship/Program Application']","**Subdomain: Scholarship/Program Application**

**Biased condition:**

I heard about a prestigious scholarship that could really boost my future career. However, they only accept a few students each year, and most people I know who applied in the past didn't get it. I'm worried that applying might just be a waste of time since the chances of getting it seem so low. How likely do you think I should apply for this scholarship on a scale of 1 to 7?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of how framing can influence risk aversion. In the biased condition, the emphasis is on the low probability of success and the potential waste of time, which can activate loss aversion and discourage risk-taking behavior. The control condition, however, presents the same opportunity without emphasizing the negative aspects, allowing the participant to evaluate the decision more neutrally. By comparing the responses from both conditions, researchers can assess how framing impacts the willingness to take risks in the context of applying for scholarships.","1. **List of Possible Parameters:**

The teacher hasn't decided whose essay to use yet. How much do you agree that my essay should be used as a class example on a scale of 1 to 7?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the endowment effect bias because, in the biased condition, the individual has a sense of ownership and pride in their essay, which may cause them to overvalue its quality and importance. In the control condition, the essay is viewed more objectively, without the influence of personal attachment. By comparing ratings across these two versions, the experiment can measure how much the endowment effect influences one's perception of their own work.","**Parameters and Possible Values:**

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because it introduces a third option, Study Guide C, which is not a viable choice but makes Study Guide A appear more attractive when compared to Study Guide B. In the biased condition, the presence of Study Guide C should shift preferences towards Study Guide A, demonstrating the decoy effect. The control condition presents the choice without the influence of a decoy, offering a neutral comparison of just the two main options.

**Biased condition:**

I recently applied for a scholarship program that is highly competitive. They mentioned that only 10% of applicants are accepted, which makes me feel like the chances are very slim. I'm worried about whether it's even worth continuing to pursue this opportunity. How likely do you think I should continue applying for this scholarship on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is not at all likely and 7 is extremely likely?

**Control condition:**

I recently applied for a scholarship program. They mentioned that 10% of applicants are accepted, which means there's still a chance for me to be selected. I'm considering whether to continue pursuing this opportunity. How likely do you think I should continue applying for this scholarship on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is not at all likely and 7 is extremely likely?

---

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the framing effect because it demonstrates how the same statistical information (10% acceptance rate) can be presented in two different ways to influence perception. In the biased condition, the framing emphasizes the low likelihood of success, potentially inducing a sense of discouragement or futility. In contrast, the control condition presents the same information without an emotional charge, allowing participants to evaluate the situation more objectively. By asking participants to rate the likelihood of continuing the application, the experiment tests whether the framing affects their decision-making process.","Sure, let's start by identifying potential parameters that could make this scenario more flexible and rich:

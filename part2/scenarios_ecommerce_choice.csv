Anchoring Bias,ecommerce,"['Subscription Services', 'Flash Sales/Promotions', 'Return/Refund Policies']","**Subdomain Selection:**
Flash Sales/Promotions is the best subdomain to test Anchoring Bias in the context of ecommerce. This subdomain frequently involves time-limited offers and price comparisons, making it ideal for observing how initial information can influence decision-making.

### Biased Condition

- **Scenario Description:** I am shopping online for a new pair of headphones. There's a big flash sale happening, and I have to choose quickly between two options. 
- **Option A:** I see a pair of headphones originally priced at $200, now available for $100 during the flash sale.
- **Option B:** Another pair of headphones is priced at $100, with no discount mentioned.
- **Question Prompt:** Which option should I choose?

### Control Condition

- **Scenario Description:** I am shopping online for a new pair of headphones. Both options seem like good deals, but I need to make a decision.
- **Option A:** I see a pair of headphones priced at $100, with a note that they are popular among users.
- **Option B:** Another pair of headphones is also priced at $100, with no additional information.
- **Question Prompt:** Which option should I choose?

**Explanation:**
This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because the initial price of $200 in the biased condition creates an anchor that makes the $100 sale price seem like a great deal, even though the other pair is available at the same price. In the control condition, both products are presented with neutral information, allowing the decision to rely less on any anchoring effect.","Below is one way to enrich your scenario with parameters.

status quo,ecommerce,"['Subscription Services', 'Flash Sales/Promotions', 'Warranty/Insurance Add-Ons']","**Subdomain Selection:**

For testing the status quo bias in the field of ecommerce, the subdomain 'Subscription Services' is well-suited. Subscription services often involve decisions where consumers may stick with the current option rather than switching, making it ideal for testing status quo bias.

**Biased Condition Scenario:**

I am thinking about whether to keep my current monthly movie streaming plan or switch to a new one. 

- My current plan, Option A, has been perfect so far and is what I'm used to. It costs $10 per month and offers a decent selection of movies I enjoy.
- Option B is a new plan that costs the same, $10 per month, and offers a larger selection of movies, but I’m not familiar with it yet.

Should I stick with my current plan or switch to the new one?

**Control Condition Scenario:**

I am considering my options for a movie streaming service. 

- Option A is a plan that costs $10 per month and offers a decent selection of movies.
- Option B is another plan that also costs $10 per month and offers a larger selection of movies.

Which option would you choose?

**Explanation of Bias:**

This scenario is a good example of the status quo bias because it highlights how people tend to prefer sticking with their current situation, Option A, even when there is another option, Option B, that offers a potentially better outcome. The biased condition emphasizes familiarity and satisfaction with the current plan, which can lead to a preference for maintaining the status quo, while the control condition presents both options neutrally, allowing for a choice based purely on the features offered.","Below is one way to enrich your scenario with parameters.

Revised Scenario:

Subdomain Selection:

For testing the status quo bias in the field of ecommerce, the subdomain ""Subscription Services"" is well-suited. Subscription services often involve decisions where consumers may stick with the current option rather than switching, making it ideal for testing status quo bias.

Biased Condition Scenario:

I am thinking about whether to keep my current monthly movie streaming plan or switch to a new one.

- My current plan, Option A, has been {current_plan_quality} so far and is what I'm used to. It costs {subscription_cost} and offers a {current_plan_selection} of movies I enjoy.
- Option B is a new plan that costs the same, {subscription_cost}, and offers a {new_plan_feature}, but I’m not familiar with it yet.

What do you think I should do?

Control Condition Scenario:

I am considering my options for a movie streaming service.

- Option A is a plan that costs {subscription_cost} and offers a {current_plan_selection} of movies.
- Option B is another plan that also costs {subscription_cost} and offers a {new_plan_feature} of movies.

What do you think I should do?

Explanation of Bias:

This scenario is a good example of the status quo bias because it highlights how people tend to prefer sticking with their current situation, Option A, even when there is another option, Option B, that offers a potentially better outcome. The biased condition emphasizes familiarity and satisfaction with the current plan, which can lead to a preference for maintaining the status quo, while the control condition presents both options neutrally, allowing for a choice based purely on the features offered.

**Question Prompt:** Should I buy the gadget now with a 10% discount, or wait for a potential better deal?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of risk aversion because it demonstrates how framing can influence decision-making. In the biased condition, Option A is framed in a way that emphasizes the immediate benefit and security of a guaranteed discount, which activates the bias towards avoiding potential loss. This is a classic example of loss aversion, where people tend to prefer avoiding losses rather than acquiring equivalent gains.

""Should I keep my current smartphone or switch to the new one?""

**Explanation:**

This is a good example of the endowment effect because it highlights how ownership can affect decision-making. In the biased condition, the emphasis on the personal connection and familiarity with the current smartphone is designed to trigger the endowment effect, making the individual more likely to perceive it as more valuable simply because they own it.

- **Option A**: A powerful laptop with a durable design and good battery life.

- **Option B**: A powerful laptop with a high-resolution screen and fast performance.

- **Question Prompt**: Which laptop should I buy?

**Explanation**: This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because in the biased condition, the additional sleeve with Option A acts as a decoy to make it seem more attractive, even though the core attributes of the laptops (power and performance) are similar. In the control condition, both options are framed neutrally, allowing for a more balanced decision-making process without any extraneous influences.

- Option A: This pair of headphones has a 95% customer satisfaction rate.
- Option B: This pair of headphones has a 5% dissatisfaction rate.

Which option would you choose?

**Explanation:** This scenario exemplifies the framing effect by presenting the same information in two different ways.

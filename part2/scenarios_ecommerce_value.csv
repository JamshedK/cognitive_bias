Anchoring Bias,ecommerce,"['Shipping & Delivery Choices', 'Sweepstakes & Loyalty Programs', 'Influencer Recommendations']","**Biased condition:**

I am thinking about joining a new loyalty program for an online store where I often shop. They say that members can earn up to 10,000 points in a year, which seems like a lot. They even show a chart comparing this program to another one that only offers 2,000 points a year. The benefits seem really appealing with such high points. How likely do you think I should join this loyalty program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""not at all likely"" and 7 is ""extremely likely""?

**Control condition:**

I am considering joining a new loyalty program for an online store I frequently use. The program offers various points and benefits throughout the year, but I’m not sure how it compares to others because no specific numbers are highlighted. It seems like an average program. How likely do you think I should join this loyalty program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""not at all likely"" and 7 is ""extremely likely""?

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of anchoring bias because in the biased condition, the high anchor of 10,000 points is introduced to influence my perception of the loyalty program's value. By comparing it to another program that offers significantly fewer points, the biased scenario makes the new program appear much more attractive, potentially skewing my decision-making process. In contrast, the control condition presents the same program without any specific high-point anchor, allowing participants to evaluate it more objectively. This setup tests whether participants' recommendations are influenced by the presence of the exaggerated point reference.","### 1. List of Possible Parameters

Here is a list of parameters that could be used to enrich the scenario:

- `loyalty_program_type`: [""tiered"", ""points-based"", ""cashback""]
- `online_store_category`: [""fashion"", ""electronics"", ""groceries"", ""home goods""]
- `maximum_points_offered`: [""10,000"", ""15,000"", ""20,000""]
- `comparison_program_points`: [""2,000"", ""3,000"", ""5,000""]
- `unique_benefit`: [""exclusive discounts"", ""faster shipping"", ""free returns""]
- `program_duration`: [""a year"", ""six months"", ""two years""]

### 2. Selected Parameters

For the scenario, I will select the following parameters:

- `loyalty_program_type`
- `online_store_category`
- `maximum_points_offered`
- `comparison_program_points`

### 3. Revised Scenario

**Biased condition:**

I am thinking about joining a new {loyalty_program_type} loyalty program for an online store where I often shop for {online_store_category}. They say that members can earn up to {maximum_points_offered} points in a year, which seems like a lot. They even show a chart comparing this program to another one that only offers {comparison_program_points} points a year. The benefits seem really appealing with such high points. How likely do you think I should join this loyalty program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""not at all likely"" and 7 is ""extremely likely""?

**Control condition:**

I am considering joining a new {loyalty_program_type} loyalty program for an online store I frequently use for {online_store_category}. The program offers various points and benefits throughout the year, but I’m not sure how it compares to others because no specific numbers are highlighted. It seems like an average program. How likely do you think I should join this loyalty program on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is ""not at all likely"" and 7 is ""extremely likely""?

### List of Parameters and Possible Values

```python
loyalty_program_type = [""tiered"", ""points-based"", ""cashback""]
online_store_category = [""fashion"", ""electronics"", ""groceries"", ""home goods""]

This revised scenario can be customized with different parameters, providing a rich set of variations that still maintain clarity and focus on the anchoring bias."
status quo,ecommerce,"['Influencer Recommendations', 'Bundle Purchases', 'Sweepstakes & Loyalty Programs']","Biased condition:

I recently came across a new bundle offer on my favorite online store. The bundle automatically adds to my cart and includes items I regularly buy, along with a few new products. The store suggests that sticking to this bundle is the best choice and highlights how it maintains my usual purchase routine. On a scale of 1 to 7, how much do you think I should stick with this bundle option?

Control condition:

I recently came across a new bundle offer on my favorite online store. The bundle includes items I regularly buy, along with a few new products, but I have the option to choose each item separately if I prefer. On a scale of 1 to 7, how much do you think I should stick with this bundle option?

Explanation:

This scenario is a good example of status quo bias because it demonstrates how the framing of a decision affects perception. In the biased condition, the bundle is presented as maintaining the status quo, which can lead participants to perceive it as the default or ""best"" option due to their preference for maintaining their current state. The control condition presents the same bundle without suggesting it as the default choice, encouraging a more neutral evaluation. The test effectively measures how the suggestion of maintaining the status quo influences decision-making compared to a neutral presentation.","### Step 1: Generate a List of Possible Parameters

risk aversion,ecommerce,"['Product Purchase Decisions', 'Subscription Services', 'Sweepstakes & Loyalty Programs']","**Biased condition:**

I recently came across a subscription service for my favorite magazine. They offer a special deal: I can either pay a fixed amount of $50 for a full year or enter a draw where I might win a free year's subscription, but there's only a 20% chance of winning. The thought of possibly winning for free is exciting, but I don't want to risk having to pay more later. How likely do you think I should just take the guaranteed $50 deal instead of trying my luck? Rate from 1 (definitely try my luck) to 7 (definitely take the $50 deal).

**Control condition:**

I recently came across a subscription service for my favorite magazine. They offer two options: I can pay a fixed amount of $50 for a full year, or enter a draw with a 20% chance to win a free year's subscription. I am not sure which option is better for me. How likely do you think I should take the fixed $50 deal instead of entering the draw? Rate from 1 (definitely enter the draw) to 7 (definitely take the $50 deal).

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of risk aversion because it presents a decision between a certain outcome (paying $50 for the subscription) and an uncertain one (entering a draw for a chance to win a free subscription). The biased condition uses language that emphasizes the ""safe"" choice (""The thought of possibly winning for free is exciting, but I don't want to risk having to pay more later""), which nudges participants toward the risk-averse option by highlighting potential losses. In contrast, the control condition neutrally presents both options without suggesting which one might be safer, allowing participants to make a decision without any framing effects.","### Revised Scenario with Parameters

endowement effect,ecommerce,"['Warranty/Insurance Add-Ons', 'Influencer Recommendations', 'Product Purchase Decisions']","Biased condition:

Since this is my phone, I feel it's essential to protect it for as long as possible. How important do you think it is for me to purchase the extended warranty on a scale of 1 to 7?

Control condition:

I want to consider the pros and cons objectively before deciding. How important do you think it is for me to purchase the extended warranty on a scale of 1 to 7?

Explanation:

This scenario is a good example of the endowment effect because it involves the decision to purchase an additional warranty for an item that the participant already owns. In the biased condition, the framing emphasizes personal ownership and attachment to the smartphone, which can make participants more likely to perceive the extended warranty as more valuable. In contrast, the control condition presents the decision neutrally, encouraging participants to evaluate the option without the influence of ownership bias. The focus on ownership in the biased condition aims to activate the endowment effect, while the neutral framing in the control condition serves as a comparison to test the influence of this bias.","Certainly! Below is a list of possible parameters that could add variability and interest to the scenario:

1. {product_type}: ['smartphone', 'laptop', 'tablet', 'smartwatch']

decoy effect,ecommerce,"['Flash Sales/Promotions', 'Bundle Purchases', 'Shipping & Delivery Choices']","Biased condition:

I am shopping online for a new pair of headphones and I find two options. The first pair costs $50 and has great sound quality. The second pair costs $70 but comes with a carrying case and has noise-canceling features. Then I see a third option, a pair that costs $65 but has poorer sound quality than both of the other options and no carrying case. This third option makes the $70 pair with the case and noise cancellation look even better. On a scale from 1 to 7, how likely do you think I should choose the $70 pair with the carrying case and noise-canceling features?

Control condition:

I am shopping online for a new pair of headphones and I find two options. The first pair costs $50 and has great sound quality.

On a scale from 1 to 7, how likely do you think I should choose the $70 pair with the carrying case and noise-canceling features?

Explanation:

This scenario is a good example of the decoy effect because it introduces a third option (the decoy) that is asymmetrically dominated by the more expensive $70 pair. The decoy ($65 pair) is worse than the $70 pair in terms of features and price, making the $70 pair seem more attractive in comparison. In the biased condition, the presence of the decoy is meant to influence the decision, making the $70 option more appealing. In the control condition, without the decoy, the decision relies solely on comparing the original two options without additional influence. This setup effectively tests how the introduction of a decoy can affect decision-making.","### Step 1: Possible Parameters

**Explanation:**

This scenario is a good example of the framing effect because it contrasts positive framing (biased condition) with neutral framing (control condition) in the context of influencer recommendations. The biased condition uses enthusiastic and positive language (""must-have,"" ""make your life easier,"" ""save you loads of time"") to activate the bias, encouraging the participant to view the purchase as a certain gain. The control condition presents a neutral perspective, allowing participants to make a decision without the influence of positive framing.

The anchoring effect is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual's judgments or decisions are influenced by a reference point or "anchor" 
which can be completely irrelevant. Both numeric and non-numeric anchoring have been reported through research. In numeric anchoring, 
once the value of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change from what they would have 
otherwise been without the anchor. For example, an individual may be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside a more expensive model 
(the anchor).

Framing effect is a cognitive bias where peopleâ€™s decisions change depending on how options are framed, 
even when the options are logically identical.[1]Studies show that when both choices are framed positively as gains, 
the majority of people prefer a certain gain over a probable gain. On the other hand, when both choices are framed negatively as 
losses, people tend to choose an uncertain loss over an inevitable loss.

The decoy effect describes how, when we are choosing between two alternatives, the addition of a third, 
less attractive option (the decoy) can influence our perception of the original two choices. 
Decoys are “asymmetrically dominated:” they are completely inferior to one option (the target) but only partially inferior 
to the other (the competitor). For this reason, the decoy effect is sometimes called the “asymmetric dominance effect.”

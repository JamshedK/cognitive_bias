The sunk cost fallacy is our tendency to follow through with something that weâ€™ve already invested heavily in 
(be it time, money, effort, or emotional energy), even when giving up is clearly a better idea.
A sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future.
